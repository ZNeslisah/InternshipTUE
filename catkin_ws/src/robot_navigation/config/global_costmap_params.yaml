  update_frequency: 10.0  #(double, default: 5.0) The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated.
  publish_frequency: 10.0 # (double, default: 0.0) The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information.
  transform_tolerance: 0.5 #  (double, default: 0.2) Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system.
