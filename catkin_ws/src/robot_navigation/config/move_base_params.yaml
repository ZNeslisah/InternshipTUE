shutdown_costmaps: false
controller_frequency: 10.0  # (double, default: 20.0) The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base.
planner_patience: 5.0 # (double, default: 5.0) How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.
controller_patience: 15.0 # (double, default: 15.0) How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.
conservative_reset_dist: 3.0 # (double, default: 3.0) The distance away from the robot in meters beyond which obstacles will be cleared from the costmap when attempting to clear space in the map.
planner_frequency: 1.0 # (double, default: 0.0) The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop. If the frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is blocked
oscillation_timeout: 10.0 #  (double, default: 0.0) How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors. A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite timeout.
oscillation_distance: 0.2 # (double, default: 0.5) How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating. Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the ~oscillation_timeout
